Scientific models in the climate domain are predominantly developed in Fortran for its high-performance and science-oriented nature. On the other hand, much of Machine Learning (ML) research is conducted in Python owing to its rich ecosystem of ML frameworks, e.g. PyTorch. 

\textbf{FTorch}~\citep{Atkinson2025} is an open source \href{https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch}{\textcolor{black}{\faGithub}}~library developed by \emph{ICCS} allowing the user to do hybrid modeling by interfacing PyTorch ML models with Fortran code. \\
